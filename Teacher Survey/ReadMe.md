Our Teacher Survey folder contains notes from our survey brainstorming session (to decide what questions would appear on our teacher survey) as well the final list of questions and teacher responses.  Our goal was to assess both the qualitative and quantitative data that teachers were interested in monitoring in their classrooms.
