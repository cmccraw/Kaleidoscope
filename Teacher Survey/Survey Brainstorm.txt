Questions + Thoughts Re: Teacher Survey


Maybe do a “scale of 1-5, how likely are you to…” kind of quiz?


What patterns in your teaching or in your classroom would you be interested in tracking? (Ex: I’m curious about how group work corresponds with test scores…)
Or, how interested would you be in tracking student success in group assignments?


Do you usually have a smartphone with you throughout your work day?
        How likely are you to check your personal electronic devices (smartphones, smart watch, etc) before school? During your planning period(s)? During lunch? After school?  During meetings?


Do you currently practice any modes of self-reflection re: your teaching that you find valuable? 


Do you feel like your value-added data (or other?) is reflective of your ability as a teacher?
        How reflective of your ability as a teacher are each of the following: value-added (EVAAS) scores, student end-of-grade/end-of-course test scores, formal administrator evaluations, peer evaluations, portfolio of artifacts, students’ end of year overall grades for your course, other?)


Are there elements of your teaching that you are proud of that you feel are not represented in value-added data or other formal evaluative measures? 


What is the biggest factor in how you determine your own success in the classroom?
